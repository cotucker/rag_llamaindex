Introduction

Welcome to the 2025 TechFlow lineup. This year, we are proud to introduce our two flagship models designed for the modern professional: the ultra-portable Velocity Air and the powerhouse Velocity Titan. Below you will find detailed specifications and use-case recommendations.
Model 1: TechFlow Velocity Air (Business Edition)

The Velocity Air is designed for the traveling executive who values portability above all else. Crafted from aerospace-grade magnesium alloy, it creates a balance between lightness and durability.

Key Features & Performance:
At the heart of the Velocity Air is the Silicon-M5 Hexa-Core processor, optimized for high efficiency. It comes standard with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM (non-upgradable) to handle multitasking with ease. The visual experience is delivered through a stunning 13.4-inch OLED display with a resolution of 1920 x 1200.

Battery & Connectivity:
Despite its small chassis, we managed to fit a 55Wh battery, which provides approximately 12 hours of continuous web browsing. Connectivity includes 2x Thunderbolt 4 ports and 1x USB-A 3.2. Note that this model does not include an HDMI port or an SD card slot, requiring a dongle for presentation setups.

Pricing & Warranty:

    MSRP: $1,299

    Weight: 0.98 kg (2.16 lbs)

Model 2: TechFlow Velocity Titan (Workstation Edition)

The Velocity Titan is built for engineers, data scientists, and video editors who need desktop-class performance in a mobile form factor. It features a robust aluminum chassis with an advanced vapor chamber cooling system.

Key Features & Performance:
The Titan is powered by the Silicon-M5 Max Dodeca-Core (12-core) processor, capable of heavy compiling and rendering tasks. It is equipped with 32GB of DDR5 RAM, which is user-upgradable up to 64GB. The display is a massive 16-inch Mini-LED panel with a resolution of 3456 x 2234 and a 120Hz refresh rate.

Battery & Connectivity:
To support high-performance workloads, the Titan houses a massive 99Wh battery. However, due to the power-hungry components, the estimated battery life is 7 hours of mixed usage. Connectivity is extensive: 3x Thunderbolt 4 ports, 1x HDMI 2.1, 1x SD Card Reader, and an Ethernet port.
